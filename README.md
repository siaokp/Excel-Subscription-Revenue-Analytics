# Excel Subscription Revenue Analytics

This repository contains an Excel-based subscription analytics project built around a custom-designed dataset. The project models subscription pricing, customer behaviour, churn, revenue performance, and time-based trends, with outputs presented through dashboards, written documentation, and a presentation.

All analysis, modelling, and visualisation are completed in Excel. The repository also includes supporting screenshots of key workbook views and dashboards.

## Project Context

The project was completed as part of a structured data analysis bootcamp. The task focused on designing a realistic subscription dataset, defining pricing and business rules, and analysing performance across customers, contracts, and time.

The emphasis was on analytical structure, metric definition, and clear communication of results.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project was custom-created to support the analysis. It simulates a subscription business with multiple pricing tiers, contract lengths, discount rules, and customer demographics.

The data includes subscription start and end behaviour, renewals, cancellations, and time-based activity to support both snapshot reporting and longitudinal analysis. All data is fictional and created for analytical purposes.

## Workbook Structure

The Excel workbook is organised to separate data, business rules, analysis, and presentation. Core sheets define subscription records and pricing assumptions, which feed into calculated fields, pivot tables, and dashboards.

The structure allows changes to pricing rules or assumptions to flow through the analysis without manual rework.

## Dashboards and Analysis

The workbook includes dashboards covering revenue performance, subscription mix, customer distribution, churn behaviour, and timeline-based trends. Pivot tables, charts, and slicers are used to support interactive exploration across tiers, contracts, regions, demographics, and time periods.

## Timeline Modelling

A dedicated timeline model tracks subscription activity over time, including new subscriptions, cancellations, net change, cumulative subscribers, and cumulative revenue. This supports analysis of growth and churn patterns across the full project period.

The timeline runs from January 2022 to January 2024, ending when the final simulated subscriber enters the system.

## Tools Used

All work was completed using Microsoft Excel. The project uses structured tables, formulas, pivot tables, pivot charts, and slicers. No external BI tools or programming languages were used.
